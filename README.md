##Installation

`npm install`

It does not require global gulp or tars-cli, but you can install it optionally.

`npm install tars-cli -g`

##Scripts

_Use regular tars-cli commands if you have global gulp and tars, this is only handy wrappers._

`npm run build` builds all project (wrapper for `tars build --silent`)   
`npm run dev` runs tars in dev mode with livereload (wrapper for `tars dev --lr`)
