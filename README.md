##Installation

`npm init`

It does not require global gulp or tars-cli, but you can install it optionally.

##Scripts

Use regular tars-cli commands if you have global gulp and tars, this is only handy wrappers.

`npm run build` builds all project (wrapper for `tars build --silent`)   
`npm run dev` runs tars in dev mode with livereload (wrapper for `tars dev --lr`)
