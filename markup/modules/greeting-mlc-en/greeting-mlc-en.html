                <p class="ulsp-content_description">Module for laser cutting (MLC) is&nbsp;intended for the cutting of&nbsp;the so&nbsp;called overblow from the hollow glass workpiece&nbsp;&mdash; a&nbsp;cognac or&nbsp;wine glass, &laquo;martini&raquo; glass and other types of&nbsp;tableware.</p>

                <p class="ulsp-content_description">This module is&nbsp;usually placed at&nbsp;the mechanical cutting section after the blowing machine and eliminates completely the need to&nbsp;process the workpieces with the traditional cutting wheel.</p>

                <p class="ulsp-content_description">Laser cutting has several unbeatable advantages. The main advantage&nbsp;&mdash; in&nbsp;the vast majority of&nbsp;cases the laser can decrease the percent of&nbsp;waste during the cutting ten and more times, providing a&nbsp;very high saving, especially when the factory is&nbsp;running 24/7.</p>

                <p class="ulsp-content_description">Such a&nbsp;decrease of&nbsp;the waste is&nbsp;achieved because the laser cutting is&nbsp;highly precise and contactless. This excludes mechanical damage of&nbsp;the glass and provides highest quality of&nbsp;the cutting edge&nbsp;&mdash; both visually and at&nbsp;the same time causing no&nbsp;tensions in&nbsp;the glass after separation of&nbsp;the overblow.</p>

                <p class="ulsp-content_description">Laser cutting is&nbsp;as&nbsp;well very clean and ecological&nbsp;&mdash; after this type of&nbsp;cutting there remain no&nbsp;glass splinter and pieces, no&nbsp;exchange of&nbsp;the cutting wheels is&nbsp;needed, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;mechanical cutting, and much less of&nbsp;the grinding is&nbsp;required afterwards, because the quality of&nbsp;the cutting edge is&nbsp;extremely high. The consumption of&nbsp;water and gas needed for cutting and grinding is&nbsp;also significantly decreased.</p>
