                <h1 class="content-title">About company Lascom</h1>

                <p class="about-content_description">Lascom designs both equipment and laser technologies for glass processing. All together it&nbsp;completely changes the traditional perception of&nbsp;the qualities of&nbsp;this material. Lascom machinery and technologies are used and applied for architectural glazing, interiors, transport and other industries.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">Lascom technologies are innovations in&nbsp;glass processing. They guarantee precision, high speed and ecologically friendly processing, which are superior to&nbsp;existing methods, while maintaining a&nbsp;considerably lower cost. Thus, the application of&nbsp;our technologies provide rapid growth in&nbsp;efficiency, while broadening the limits of&nbsp;glass application.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">Quite a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;world leaders in&nbsp;the glass processing industry have become Lascom customers. Companies from Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Southern Korea, Austria and Czech Republic have made their choice in&nbsp;the favor of&nbsp;Lascom, with an&nbsp;immediate positive economic effect, and improvements in&nbsp;quality.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">Lascom business area</h2>
                <p class="about-content_description">The manufacturing of&nbsp;equipment for heated glass production is&nbsp;our main focus. Our machines remove electric conductive coating and apply busbars. All equipment is&nbsp;delivered together with specially designed software for glass processing control.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">The software calculates the pattern of&nbsp;laser pathways&nbsp;&mdash; &laquo;cutoffs&raquo; as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;busbars on&nbsp;the electric conductive coating in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;achieve the desired parameters of&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain product, for example, to&nbsp;bring down the difference between the coldest and hottest spots on&nbsp;a&nbsp;glass sheet.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">Another direction Lascom is&nbsp;moving towards is&nbsp;laser cutting of&nbsp;hollow glass. Such a&nbsp;unit has been integrated into a&nbsp;line for glass production by&nbsp;our customer in&nbsp;Czech Republic. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the customer has achieved a&nbsp;considerable level of&nbsp;spoilage recession already in&nbsp;the stage of&nbsp;cutting and, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural consequence, on&nbsp;other stages of&nbsp;production too.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">Source of inspiration</h2>
                <p class="about-content_description">Lascom has been established on&nbsp;the basis of&nbsp;scientific research and the experience of&nbsp;Pelcom Machinebuilding Plant Ltd.</p>
                <p class="about-content_description">In&nbsp;2011 it&nbsp;was proven obvious that the technologies designed and developed in&nbsp;Pelcom are unique and the approaches to&nbsp;glass processing are positively far beyond the traditional ones. Thus after these technologies had been applied, new test equipment was created and its high business performance left no&nbsp;doubts.</p>
                <p class="about-content_description">The way in&nbsp;which the developed technologies and their successful introduction into the glass industry were implemented, resulted in&nbsp;the establishment of&nbsp;Lascom, that has been focusing on&nbsp;innovations in&nbsp;equipment design, development and production.</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">Our team</h2>
                <p class="about-content_description">The employees of&nbsp;Lascom, of&nbsp;which 6 are certified engineers, are the authors of&nbsp;dozens of&nbsp;patents and inventor’s&nbsp;certificates, who are regularly published in&nbsp;core publications as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;in&nbsp;international conferences proceedings.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">In&nbsp;2005 the Lascom team were awarded the Science and Technology Prize by&nbsp;the Government of&nbsp;the Russian Federation for new glass processing technologies, design and development.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">Our engineers were also awarded the Bereznyak prize and Brussels World’s&nbsp;Fair.</p>


                <h2 class="content-title">Our fundamental advantages</h2>
                <p class="about-content_description">The main advantage of&nbsp;our company is&nbsp;the possibility to&nbsp;synergize scientific research results with practical integration of&nbsp;the technologies. Cooperation between young researchers, engineers and service specialists in&nbsp;one team allows Lascom customers to&nbsp;follow and apply modern technologies and embody ideas that once seemed impossible, for instance, making glass products whose parameters are beyond those of&nbsp;traditional ones.</p>

                <p class="about-content_description">Our customers’ stable development is&nbsp;ensured by&nbsp;the fact that Lascom meets high quality standards in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;equipment and components as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;multilevel pre-sale testing of&nbsp;the latter.</p>
