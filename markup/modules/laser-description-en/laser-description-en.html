                <p class="laser-content_description laser-content_description__mobile">Laser lifetime makes 50&nbsp;000 hours with no&nbsp;maintenance involved. Lascom has extensive information about 500 laser types produced by&nbsp;IPG Photonics. Each of&nbsp;these lasers has a&nbsp;life time above 50&nbsp;000 hours. Since the moment of&nbsp;the first laser table delivery, only one laser has ever become out of&nbsp;order. However, after a&nbsp;quick repair, the laser was back to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;normal operation.</p>

                <p class="laser-content_description laser-content_description__mobile">The laser removes coating with a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;6&nbsp;m/sec on&nbsp;straight lines and 360 mm<sup>2</sup>/sec on&nbsp;flat areas. When laser technology is&nbsp;compared with the traditional method of&nbsp;acid etching in&nbsp;similar conditions, the speed of&nbsp;removal by&nbsp;laser can be&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;15 times higher.</p>


                <p class="laser-description-content_description">Regardless of&nbsp;fast speeds, cut-offs accuracy is&nbsp;rather high. The width of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cut off can be&nbsp;adjusted from 50 micron (optionally from 35 micron) up&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;few mm. In&nbsp;the air a&nbsp;cut off 0,5 mm&nbsp;wide withstands 1 kilovolt with no&nbsp;electrical breakdown. When a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;construction (e.g. laminated glass), a&nbsp;0,05 mm&nbsp;wide cut-off withstands 600 Volts due to&nbsp;the complete coating removal with the help of&nbsp;the laser. At&nbsp;the same time the surface of&nbsp;the glass remains intact.</p>

                <p class="laser-description-content_description">High productivity and accuracy brings the cost of&nbsp;products down. Moreover the number of&nbsp;personnel involved in&nbsp;the process is&nbsp;also reduced. Only one operator is&nbsp;needed in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;line for heated glass production.</p>

                <p class="laser-description-content_description">Unlike the traditional acid etching method, laser production is&nbsp;absolutely harmless for an&nbsp;operator, which is&nbsp;undoubtedly another important advantage. The harmlessness of&nbsp;laser production is&nbsp;attested by&nbsp;the results of&nbsp;the testing laboratory.</p>
