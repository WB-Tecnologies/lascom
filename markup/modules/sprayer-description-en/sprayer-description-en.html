                <p class="laser-content_description laser-content_description__mobile">GDS applies the conductive busbars at&nbsp;the speed of&nbsp;40 mm/sec. This allows to&nbsp;use the machine together with the ULSP without decreasing the overall heated glass production performance. The time required for the application of&nbsp;busbars is&nbsp;normally shorter than that required for the laser processing of&nbsp;the corresponding glass sheet.</p>

                <p class="laser-content_description laser-content_description__mobile">The warranty period of&nbsp;GDS is&nbsp;normally two years (depending on&nbsp;the contract conditions).</p>

                <p class="laser-description-content_description">Metal powder particles of&nbsp;a&nbsp;specified size are accelerated through a&nbsp;special process until they have a&nbsp;speed that is&nbsp;high enough for the application process. After that the stream of&nbsp;these particles is&nbsp;directed right onto the surface of&nbsp;the glass at&nbsp;a&nbsp;required angle, and this leads to&nbsp;the &laquo;sticking&raquo; of&nbsp;the particles to&nbsp;the glass surface in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;metal strip. A&nbsp;small amount of&nbsp;particles due to&nbsp;various reasons may not stick to&nbsp;the glass and is&nbsp;evacuated with the aspiration system directly in&nbsp;the application zone so&nbsp;it&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;get into the environment.</p>

                <p class="laser-description-content_description">GDS complies with the requirements for the air and environmental pollution as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;for the noise pollution. The operator of&nbsp;GDS doesn’t&nbsp;need any special protection means. GDS can be&nbsp;placed in&nbsp;regular facilities of&nbsp;the glass processing companies.</p>
